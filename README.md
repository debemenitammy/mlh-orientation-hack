# Inspiration :bulb:

This application was inspired by the MLH Orientation Hack organized by the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source) 2022 Spring Batch. The [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.is/) Team of three(3) came up with idea to build this application called [Github Stars](https://mlh-orientation-hack.vercel.app/) during a four(4) days Hackathon.
The Team saw the need to build an application that many Github users will find useful, beneficial and fun to use. <br>

# What is it:question:
Github Stars is a software application that allows Github Users enter their Github repository link and see the Profile Picture(s) and name(s) of the number of Github Users that have starred their projects. The Github Stars application was built with Next.js and [Github Graphql API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).

## Prerequisites :technologist:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
